# Occupancy Level Prediction with K-means Clustering

This project is created to predict the occupancy level of the building for the controling of air ventilation system efficiently. The simple and effective approach is application of clustering methods because of not having output data to teach ML model. K-means is classical but also, popular and simple clustering algorithm which is assumed appropriate for this problem.
The dataset which are used for this project was collected in the experiment room of Tallinn University of Technology.

Power BI report of project is shown below.
